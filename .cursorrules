We are building with nextjs and tailwindcss.

We will deploy to github pages. So avoid dynamic components that require server side rendering.
If you see any components that are not static, please convert them to static and tell me.

Think the following before answering:
- what's the core problem to be solved?
- what's best practice for current tech stack?
- what's the most efficient way to implement?

After thinking, reflect:
- why is this the best solution?
- are we following best practice?
- do we over-complicate things?

If you are not sure, ask me.
If you think it's good answer after all previous questions, give your answer.
If you see additional considerations, and think it's simple fix, please do so. Otherwise, please mention it.
